            <h1 align="center">What is Plasma?</h1>
            <p>All matter is made out of atoms which are composed of a nucleus and electrons.  The 
            nucleus has <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">protons</span> and 
            <b>neutrons</b>.  Around the nucleus, are the <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">
            electrons</span>.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="txt2">
            <p>The <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">protons</span> are charged
            POSITIVELY, the <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">
            electrons</span> are charged NEGATIVELY and the <b>neutrons</b> are neutral.  Most
            of the matter around us, solids, liquids and gases, are made out of neutral atoms and
            molecules (collection of atoms), that is, there are the SAME number of
            protons and electrons.</br><br>
            If for some reason, like collisions with a fast electron, an atom ejects an
            electron, then the neutral atom will now be POSITIVE and the free
            electron is NEGATIVE (for simplicity, we'll use Helium (<em>He</em>) atom, with 2 protons, 2
            neutrons, 2 electrons, as the gas.  Helium is very commonly used in laboratory
            plasma experiments):</p>

            <p>The positively charged atom is called an ION.  The more electrons are ejected, the
            more positively charged it is.  This process is called <b>ionization</b>.</br></br>
            Plasma is the state of matter made out of ionized atoms (i.e. ions)
            and free electrons:</p>

        <div class="txt4">
            <p>Since the particles need to be energetic enough to undergo ionizing collisions, and energetic
            particles simply means that they're <b>hot</b>, plasma is the hottest of the 4 states of matter.</br></br>
            While most of the matter we come in contact with is solid, liquid, or gas, the
            visible universe is more than 99% plasma.</br></br>
            Here are some examples of plasmas:</p>

            <p>In the next section, "Why does the plasma glow?", we will explore the physics
            behind this very important phenomenon, including how it can help us explore far away stars!</p>
