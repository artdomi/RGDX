    <p>Let&apos;s start with a simpler question:  What is a magnet? We&apos;ve all seen horseshoe and bar magnets before:</p>

    <div style="height:200px">
    	<div class="left">

		<p>They&apos;re made out of metal (not just any metal, <a
		href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferromagnetism" target="_blank">
		ferromagnetic metals</a>),
		and have two poles, north and south.  Magnets create invisible lines in space that go from
		one pole to the other called <b>Magnetic Fields
		(noted with the letter B)</b>.</br></br>
		If you&apos;re a piece of iron (or another of these special types of
		metals), and are placed close to a strong magnet, you will be attracted
		to the closest pole and will follow the field line to it.</p>
	</div>
	<div style="height:200px;clear:both">
		<div class="left" style="width:320px;margin-top:30px">
    		<p>As you may also know, when you get two magnets close, the opposite
			poles attract, while equal poles repel.</p>

			<p>The names North and South are no coincidence.  The earth (and most
			stars and planets) behave like a bar magnet, creating magnetic fields
			that extend far from the surface.  But the bar is upside down?!  Why?<br><br>
			We call it the north pole because the north of the compass points there.  But
			a compass is just a magnet that is free to move around and align itself
			with the earth&apos;s field.  So (as seen above) the compass north aligns with
			the earth&apos;s magnetic south pole! </p>

			<p>In reality, the sun actually pushes the earth&apos;s magnetic field
			away and lead to very interesting phenomena called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_reconnection">magnetic reconnection</a>...but
			let&apos;s get back to magnets.</p>

		<p>It turns out that electricity, the same one coming out of a
		wall socket or a battery, can also create magnetic fields.  Before we
		go on, make sure you&apos;ve read the "What is the electrode voltage
		and how do I control it?" page, where we discuss the concept of voltages and currents.

			<p>In the 19th century, it was discovered that when a current flows
			(like down a wire), a magnetic field is formed around the current
			of the same type as the one made by the magnets discussed earlier.

		<p>Therefore, if you wrap a wire around and form many loops of current,
		you can create a magnet similar to the bar magnet:</p>

	<p>With the added benefit that you can control the strength of
	the magnetic field by controlling the current that passes through it!</br>

		<p>The electromagnets create a magnetic field in the same direction
		as the axis of the tube and particularly strong between the coils,
		as shown below:</p>

	<h2 class="content-h2">How do I control the electromagnets?</h2>
	<p>The strength of the field is proportional to the current
	flowing in the coil, which, in turn, is proportional to
	the voltage supplied to the coils.</br></br>
	To control the strength of the magnetic field, you can use the <span style="color:darkred">red slider</span>.  The slider changes
	the voltage across the coils, changing the current supplied to the magnets leading to a magnetic field at the center of the coils
	of about 0-130 Gauss (about 300 times the earth's magnetic field).</p>

	on...what do you see?</br></br>
