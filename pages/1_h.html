    <h1 class="content-h1">What does the electromagnet do to the plasma?</h1>
    <p>Have you tried turning on the electromagnet while the plasma&apos;s on?</p>
    <li><p>Set the pressure to 40 mTorr</p></li>
    <li><p>Set the electrode voltage to 2000 Volts</p></li>
    <li><p>Turn the electromagnet on to 200 Gauss</p></li>
    <b>Do you see something like what&apos;s shown below?</b></p>

    <p>We have already seen that plasma responds to the voltage across the electrodes, just turn
    the electrode voltage up and down and see the changes in the plasma.</br></br>
    <b>Now we see that the plasma also reacts to magnetic fields!</b></br></br>
    As seen in the figure below, when a negatively or positively charged particle
    <em>sees</em> a magnetic field, the particle starts spiraling around it.</p>

        <img src="./img/gyro.png" alt="gyro" style="width:440px">
    </div>
    <p>Now, the radii of these spirals are known as the electron and ion
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroradius">gyroradii</a> and depend
    on the magnetic field and on the temperature of the plasma.</br></br>
    For our case, the sizes are of the order of an inch.</br></br>
    If we now look at the picture of the magnetic field of the Helmholtz coil,
    the squeezing of the plasma makes sense!  As the plasma spirals around the
    field lines, it gets redirected due to the curvature of the fields.</p>

        <img src="./img/gyrosqueeze.jpg" alt="gyrosqueeze" style="width:440px">
    </div>
    <p>You can see that the plasma is kept away from the glass between the coils.</br>
    This fact is critical to one of the main missions of the Princeton Plasma Physics
    Lab and other plasma labs around the world: <b>Magnetically Confined Fusion</b>.

    We mentioned in "What is plasma" that the northern lights are also plasma.  Now
    you can understand why we only see them in the poles:</p>
    <div>
        <img src="./img/Magnetosphere_rendition.jpg" alt="northernlights" style="width:100%">
    </div>
    </p>As solar winds (made out of plasma) reach the earth&apos;s magnetic
    fields, they follow the fields towards the north and south poles.  The
    northern (and southern) lights are seen when the plasma interacts with the
    atmoshphere.
