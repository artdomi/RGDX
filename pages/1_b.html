	<h2 class="content-h2">Before we begin, get a feel for the lag time:</h2>
	<p>The video streaming has a few seconds of lag time which you should take into account.  By turning the auxiliary light on and off and observing the streaming,
	you can get a feel for this lag.</p>
	<div>
		<img src="./img/timelag.jpg" alt="timelag" style="max-width:100%;max-height:100%">
	</div>
	<p>If the lag is too long (more than 4 seconds) reload the page.</br>
	While it may take a little time to get used to this lag, it will not be
	too much of a problem for the RGDX experience.</p>

	<h2 class="content-h2">To start out, let&apos;s make it glow:</h2>

	<li><p>Make sure the electromagnet is set to 0 Gauss and the auxiliary light is
	turned off</p></li>
	<div style="margin-left:200px;marign-right:200px">

	</div>
	<li><p>Set the pressure in the tube to about 40mTorr (if not already set)</il>
	</br>
	<li><p>Wait a few seconds for the pressure to stabilize (between 30mTorr
	and 50mTorr is fine)</p></li>

	<li><p>Turn up the voltage between the electrodes</p></li>
	<li><p>At approximately 800 V, a glow discharge will appear</p></li>
	<li><p>Raise the voltage to 2000 V</p></li>

	<h2 class="content-h2">What are we looking at?</h2>
	<p>Before the voltage is high enough, almost all the air is neutral atoms and molecules.  In the drawing below
	the neutral atoms are highlighted just to identify them as neutral.</p>
	<div>
		<img src="./img/air.jpg" alt="air" style="width:100%">
	</div>
	<p>When the voltage is high enough, the air conducts electricity and the atoms and molecules start to
	lose electrons...some of the neutral atoms and molecules turn
	into <span style="color:fuchsia;font-weight:bold">plasma</span>.</p>
	<div>
		<img src="./img/plasma.jpg" alt="plasma" style="width:100%">
	</div>
	<p>Plasma, sometimes referred to as the 4<sup>th</sup> state of matter, is gas that has positive and negative
	charged particles.</p>
