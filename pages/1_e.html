	<p>As you saw in "What am I looking at?",
	the gas inside the RGDX is air which
	is composed primarily of nitrogen and oxygen molecules.</br>
	But they&apos;re not standing still...as a matter of fact each particle is moving
	in a random direction at around <a href="http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/

			<p>As the molecules hit the glass, the glass exerts a force and they bounce back.  The larger the area of glass you look at, the more molecules are hitting it and the more net force is exerted.  Therefore, we talk about the the net force <em>divided</em> by the area.  This is the <b>pressure</b>.</p>

			<p>At sea level, the weight of all the air in the atmosphere leads to an air
			pressure of around 760 Torr (Torr is a unit of pressure, named after the
			scientist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelista_Torricelli"
			target="_blank">
			Evangelista Torricelli</a> who was among the first to measure
			atmospheric pressures).<br><br>
			By connecting a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_vane_pump"
			 target="_blank">vacuum pump</a>, some molecules are removed from the
			 tube.  The fewer molecules there are inside hitting the glass,
			the lower the pressure.  Using the pump, we can reach pressures
			of about 8 milliTorr (mTorr) or 100,000 lower than atmospheric pressure.

	<h2 class="content-h2">How do we control the pressure of the RGDX?</h2>
	<p>The RGDX vacuum system is shown below:</p>
        <div>
            <img src="./img/vacuum_system.jpg" alt="vacuum_system" style="width:100%">
        </div>
        <p><b>Manometer:</b>  It measures the pressure in the vessel and <em>tells</em>
		the MKS controller.  This model has a 0-1000 mTorr range.<br><br>
		<b>Vacuum Pump:</b> A vane mechanical pump capable of lowering the pressure in
		the vessel to approximately 8 mTorr.<br><br>
		<b>Shutoff Valve:</b>  Manual valve which can be used to stop airflow
		if needed.  Normally kept open.<br><br>
		<b>Needle Valve:</b> Remote controlled valve.  The flow is controlled by the
		MKS controller.<br><br>
		<b>MKS Controller:</b>  Connected to the computer.  When you set the pressure
		the controller detects the current pressure from
		the manometer and opens or closes the needle valve to reach the desired pressure.<br>
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>You may notice a couple of things:</p>
		<p><b>Once you set a given pressure, the reading typically overshoots:</b><br>
		This makes sense since the controller reacts to the live reading of
		the manometer.  Just give it some time to stabilize.</p><br>
		<p><b>It takes a long time to reach the lowest pressures:</b><br>
		For the low pressures, the needle valve is closed and the pressure is limited
		by the strength of the pump.  Don&apos;t expect to go below approximately
		8 mTorr, the pump simply can&apos;t reach such low pressures.</p>
		<p>With this you should be all set with using the pressure control.  Have fun!</p>
