    <h2 class="content-h2">What&apos;s voltage?</h2>
    <p>You&apos;ve probably heard the word <em>voltage</em>
    when talking about batteries and appliances.  To start,
    we should talk about charges:</br></br>
    As you saw in "What is plasma?", all of matter is made out of atoms which are
    composed of a nucleus and electrons.  The nucleus has
    POSITVE <span style="color:red">protons</span> and
    neutral <b>neutrons</b>.  Around the nucleus, are the NEGATIVE
    <span style="color:blue">electrons</span>.   We also saw that
    an ion is an atom that is charged either positively or
    negatively by changing the number of electrons.</p>

    </div>
    <p>When a conductor (like a metal) has a buildup of charges, be
    it positive or negative, nature wants to neutralize this by
    either flowing the excess charges away from it or bringing opposite
    charges into it.</br></br>
    In the figure, a metal ball has an excess of electrons, therefore
    it is charged negatively.  It <em>wants</em> to discharge either
    by ejecting electrons (left) or by attracting positive ions (right).</p>
    <div>
        <img src="./img/neutralization.jpg" alt="neutralization"  style="width:100%">
    </div>
    <p>When we have two conducting objects with different charge imbalance, for
    example, one with excess electrons and the other with excess positive
    ions (as shown below), then it is said that there is
    a <b>voltage</b> between the two objects:</p>
    <div>
        <img src="./img/voltage1.png" alt="voltage1" style="width:100%">
    </div>
    <p>The metal objects are called the <b>electrodes</b>.<br>
    The flow of charged particles is what we call a <b>current</b> and its
    symbol is typically <b>I</b>.  Note that the current is DEFINED as
    going in the same direction as the flow if the charges are positive
    and in the opposite direction if the charges are negative, for
    example, in the picture below, both the electrons and the ions are
    creating a current flowing to the right:</p>
    <div>
        <img src="./img/voltage2.png" alt="voltage2" style="width:100%">
    </div>
    <p>So, when there is a voltage between two electrodes and the charged
    particles are free to move between the electrodes, a current is
    generated from the more POSITVE electrode to the more NEGATIVE
    one regardless of what particles are moving.  In practice
    it&apos;s usually only the electrons that move.</br></br>

    <h2 class="content-h2">So, how can we create a voltage in a lab? </h2>
    <p>In the lab there are voltage differences across battery terminals, power
    supplies or between electrical socket plug holes.</br></br>
    A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)"
    target="_blank">battery</a> uses electrochemical cells to keep positive and negative
    charges separated in the two sides of the battery (or electrodes).  By
    connecting the two electrodes using an electric conductor (a wire for example)
    you let the charges flow to neutralize them, in other words, we
    let a current flow.</p>
    <div style="height:400px">
        <div class="left" style="Width:300px;margin-top:50px">
            <p>In a conductor, it is typically the electrons that are mobile,
            therefore, the current is due to their movement.</br></br>
            Just as a baseball has kinetic energy as it moves, the electrons
            have energy as they flow.  We can use this energy to light up a
            bulb, for example...or to light up a plasma glow discharge!</p>

    <p>Voltage is measured in volts (not surprisingly).  A typical AA battery
    has a voltage of about 2.5 volts, or 2.5V, between the two
    electrodes.  The rectangular ones have 9V.<br>
    The wall socket gives a voltage of 120V but it swings positive
    to negative and back 60 times a second.</p>

    <p>In the RGDX, we use a power supply which we can set the voltage
    manually (or, in your case, remotely).  By using the <span style="color:darkblue">blue voltage control
    slider</span>, you can set the voltage yourself from 0V to 2000V (almost
    20 times higher voltage than the wall socket)!</p>
