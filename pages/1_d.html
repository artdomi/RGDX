    <h1 class="content-h1">Why does the plasma glow?</h1>
    <p>From the "What is Plasma?" page, we
    saw that the glow is actually plasma,
    a lot of positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons held at
    high temperatures.</br></br>
    Sometimes (very often), the electrons RECOMBINE with the ions:

    </div>
	<p>The recombination leads to a neutral (or less ionized) atom.  But,
	in order to conserve energy, the atom releases a <span style="color:fuchsia;
	font-wight:bold">photon</span>, which is just light.</br></br>
	Another way light is emitted is when an electron is at a high energy
	level (that is, further away from the nucleus) and then transitions to a more
	favorable, lower energy level:

    <p>The higher the drop the more energy the photon has to have. The
	energy of the photon determines its color:

    </div>
    <p>Since each atom and molecule has its own preferred transitions (given by their
	electronic configuration), each one has an emission fingerprint.<br>
	Here are a few examples:
	</p>
    <div>
        <img src="./img/air_spectra.jpg" alt="air_spectra" style="width:100%">
    </div>
   <p>Since air is mostly composed of N<sub>2</sub> (nitrogen), O<sub>2</sub>
	(oxygen) and water vapor, the spectra shown above are the main ones
	observed in the RGDX, primarily the N<sub>2</sub>, as seen below:

	<p>There is a whole field of study that concentrates on studying the relation
	between matter and its interaction with light called <b>spectroscopy</b>.</p>

    <p>One of the great historical uses of spectroscopy has been to study the composition,
	temperature, density, etc. of far away stars.<br><br>
    In the video below University of Manchester professor Brian Cox gives a quick
    (4 minute) explanation of how this is done:</p>
